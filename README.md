# 2015-Final-Java-Project
The final project for my Introduction to Java class.

This program is for a fictional diner and allows the user to select a table (1-10), enter the name of the waiter for the selected table and order food from a hard-coded menu.  Food items can be removed from the order and the entire bill can also be cleared as needed.

It is not perfect and there are things I would probably change if I were to do this project again, but I think it is a nice, neat, tight little program.

I am a new GitHub user, but I think I've got the files properly organized.  They should run, but it might take some fiddling since I uploaded the files and did all the organizing myself.
