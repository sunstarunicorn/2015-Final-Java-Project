# 2015-Final-Java-Project
The final project for my Introduction to Java class.

This program is for a fictional diner and allows the user to select a table (1-10), enter the name of the waiter for the selected table and order food from a hard-coded menu.  Food items can be removed from the order and the entire bill can also be cleared as needed.

It is not perfect and there are things I would probably change if I were to do this project again, but I think it is a nice, neat, tight little program.

Additionally, since I am a raw beginner in GitHub, the uploaded files are a bit...jumbled and probably won't run right.  If I ever figure out how to fix that, I will, but for now, all the files except for the image, this readme, and the license should be in a src folder.  The image needs to go into an img folder in the same directory as the src folder for the program to run properly.
